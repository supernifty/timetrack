# timetrack
Simple time tracking of computer usage - with notifications - for Mac OSX

## Motivation
I was __shocked__ to learn how much of my life I spend dealing with email. I thought I was spending my day doing research but in fact, it's primarily dealing with email.

I wanted something to keep me up to date real-time on how I was spending my day on the computer - with notifications to keep me informed if something was taking over my day.

There are lots of task tracking applications out there, probably a lot more sophisticated than this one. This particular application:
* is free.
* is open-source.
* runs **locally** - keep your own data private and to yourself.
* provides a simple summary - easily get an immediate overview of your day and week.
* has notifications.

It's currently configured for my own use-case, but if other people use it, I'll add settings to suit other peoples' use-cases.

## Coming soon!
